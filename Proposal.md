# RPG Proposal 

## What is Siletha-2D? Siletha is the name of the game I'm trying to develop in Unity, so I have a base concept of story and mechanics. I'm going to try to convert that to a 2D RPG, similar to an early Final Fantasy or Pokemon combat system.  

## Wireframe  (Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure: The challenges I can anticipate are the length of time I'd spend specifically manipulating the DOM for each fight sequence. Or overall creating the functions for a turn based combat system. What I plan on doing feature wise is creating something similar to the Create Your Own Adventure game we did on day 2 or 3 but if you enter a certain area you encounter a fight. The fight would be turn based with "player 2" being the AI of the monster. You would be able to use certain moves once every 2 turns, and each attack would affect a health bar. 

## Phases of Completion: 
## -Create a simple layout of each scene. Where buttons would go which would allow me to figure out what functions I'm going to need
## -Layout the empty functions in my .js file and add pseudocode of what I would need to accomplish in those functions
## -Begin programming
